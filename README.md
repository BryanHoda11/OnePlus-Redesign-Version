## Pointers for this Project :

```
1. This is my biggest project yet! Designing such a big website of a brand as big as OnrPlus, was hell of a ride but truly a fun one.

```

```
2. I went through several brands but decided to do OnePlus as I thought I can add somethings which there isn't in the original website.

```

```
3. I learnt a lot of things in one project itself and I am delighted I got to clarify my React JS concepts well and I applied them wherever necessary.

```

```
4. I copy pasted the Navbar in each component as I added the dark theme feature and I had to use its State and function in each page. It was a big task but I achieved what I wanted to do in the end :)

```

```
5. Overall this project was a fun and wild run with a lot of learning (started 17th July 2024 & ended on 13th Aug 2024). So nearly a month.
I also added responsiveness in the Phone page which wasn't there in the original website and obviously the dark theme.

Thank you!
